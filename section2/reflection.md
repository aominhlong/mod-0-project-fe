## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

The main two takeaways that resonated with me are:
    * **Continue** to seak out challenges and it is ok to fail. This is so true. If you do not fail, you will not grow and if you don't challenge yourself, how are you supposed to know what you are lacking or where you can improve?
    * **ASK FOR HELP**
        * It is okay to ask for help! If you are struggling, chances are, someone else has or is struggling with your current problem. You will never know the answer *if* you don't ask.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

    * I love challenges. I really like to see where I am at and where I need to grow or improve.
    * I sometimes struggle to ask for help because I can be stubborn or I 'don't want to look stupid'. I realized that someone is probably struggling with the same problem I am and it is better to just ask for help when it is appropriate. I made it a goal for myself to not be stubborn anymore and ask for help when it is appropriate.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

    * I remember how to run and do a lot of the stuff from section1. However, I had a type and I couldn't find it for awhile!
        * I was about to ask for help but remembered that I need to skim the code for spelling errors and I luckily found them!
    * It taught me to be more careful about mistakes but also check if I spelt everything right and if the code makes sense.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

    * A conditional statement tells a computer what to execute based on if a condition has been met.
    * An example of this in `Google Calendar`. If a scheduled event is at a certain time, send a `notification` or play a `sound` when it is that *specific* time.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement by using `else if`. If `condition 1` is **true**, then the subsequent code block will execute. *Else if* condition one is **false**, then execute the next code block if condition 2 is **true**. This can continue for as long as a condition isn't met. `else` can be used at the end if the conditions above are **not *true**.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

    * We can use logical operators `and` or `or`. I actually got to use it for the `if-statements` exercise. I did use google for a little bit of help.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

    * What are main/most common bugs in `if` functions caused by that I should be careful about? Formatting? Typos?
    * What are the general processes I should go through if I get an error or my code isn't running? Look for typos first?
