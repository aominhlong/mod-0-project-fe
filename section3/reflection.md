## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
    - I felt like I have come really far since the start of this class. I am really proud that I am starting to get the basics down and understand the 'why' of things.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
    - An array is a variable that stores a list of values.
    - Based on this definition, an app where developers probably use arrays is *Youtube*. If I hit the *app* icon in the top right corner, a list will come down. This is an array. Another example is when I use *Spotify* where I click on *Your Library* which holds my playlists.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
    - An array method is a type of syntax that changes an array. An example of this would be `pop()` which removes the last element from the array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
    - A loop is when you write code for a single action but instruct the program to carry out that action `n` number of times.
    - You would want to use a loop with an array to avoid the process of manually typing out an action for the values in the array.
    - You would use a loop without an array if you knew how many loops you needed.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
    - A loop is something that lets you keep doing the same thing over and over again. Similar to a repeat button (if they know what that is).

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
    - It took me so long to figure out the last problem for loops-arrays.js. I was wondering what are the *general* rules when you want to combine different variable key words (var, for, if, etc) to use with each other? Is there a certain order for specific variable key words where one needs to go before the other? Can arrays be inside one another? If so, how many arrays can be inside each other until your code breaks?
