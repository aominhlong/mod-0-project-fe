## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel pretty good moving forward. I am still a little shy but I will try my best to continue to ask questions if I do not know it.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

The first data type is a `string` which are letters, characters, or numbers wrapped within quotes.
The second data type is a `number` which are all numbers including decimals and negative numbers. Larger numbers will not have decimals.
The third data type is called a `boolean` which are where values are either true or false.  

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

First, I would assign the `Hello World` to the variable name `hi`. It would look like this: var hi = "Hello World ";. I would then use a concatenate to join `!` with the string. The console log should look like this: console.log(hi + "!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

To indicate comments in a JavaScript file: `//` or `/*   */` can be used. The purpose of a code comment is to leave a comment on a code for other developers or to deactivate a code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is something that has a value. To explain it to a 5 year old, I would say that a variable is like a memory that we want to save. It can be a big memory or a small memory and can have different things like words or numbers.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

An app I use is Facebook. Three variables and the data they hold is probably: gender = Male, name = my name, and education = Colorado State University.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

A concatenation joins two strings together by using the `+` character.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Youtube probably uses concatenations when for videos or surveys with more than one language. Facebook might use it for the same purpose when having a translation at the bottom of a comment.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Are we supposed to be doing the exercises in the book? Chapter 1 had exercises, but we have only done little to no work with HTML, CSS, or Javascript.
Will we have projects every week that we need to do when Module 1 starts?
